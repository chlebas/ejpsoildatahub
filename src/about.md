# About EJPSoil Datahub

The catalogue contains metadata and includes links to, and information about the datasets. It includes mechanisms for improvement of metadata through a participatory approach through ‘Edit on Git’ (see How does it work and how to operate, and the tutorials). The catalogue is provided with searching tools as described in the following paragraphs of the present deliverable. Tutorials are supplied on how to use the catalogue, and these tutorials were included in the EJP SOIL T5.5 capacity building courses on soil data assimilation (6-8 April 2022 and 24-26 January 2023).  

The catalogue itself can be accessed at: https://catalogue.ejpsoil.eu. These pages provide some background to the catalogue content. Overview diagrams of the catalogue content are available on a [dashboard](https://dashboards.isric.org/superset/dashboard/29)

The catalogue provides an overview and allows better findability of relevant authoritative and research soil datasets that can be used by the Mission Soil, the Mission Soil projects, other soil research projects, single researchers and by local, regional, national and European authorities. There are no restrictions on access to the metadata and it is therefore of value to the entire EU soil community and adjacent domains. The EJP SOIL catalogue will be transferred in 2025 to the European Soil Observatory. 

## Contents
 
At present, the metadata catalogue contains metadata from these sources: 

- The [EJP SOIL surveys conducted in 2020](https://github.com/ejpsoil/ejpsoildatahub/blob/main/datasets/countries/index.csv) and published in D6.1 and D2.2 on available soil and soil management datasets in EJP SOIL countries. 

- The [MensMeu 1.0 survey](https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/projects/inspire-and-soil-data) conducted by JRC and DG-ENV 

- [EJP SOIL produced data](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/862695/results) in WPs or in internal research projects 

- Metadata of datasets harvested from [ESDAC](https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/resource-type/datasets) 

We kindly ask you to report any issues on existing registrations or to suggest missing entries via a [git issue](https://github.com/ejpsoil/ejpsoildatahub/issues).

Metadata records are stored in a conveniant [MCF format](https://geopython.github.io/pygeometa/reference/mcf/), a metadata convention from the geopython community, which is a compatible subset of ISO19115. If you prefer a guided editor, consider to modify the record using [mdme](https://osgeo.github.io/mdme/).

## EJP SOIL

The overall goal of the [EJP SOIL](https://ejpsoil.eu/about-ejp-soil) programme is to build a sustainable European integrated research system and develop and deploy a reference framework on climate-smart, sustainable agricultural soil management. EJP SOIL unites a unique group of 26 partners from 24 European countries, > 400 scientists in a 5 year programme (2020 - 2025).
