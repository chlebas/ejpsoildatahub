"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6472390";Zenodo;Long term climatic data for i-SoMPE;olivier.heller@agroscope.admin.ch;28-2-2022;"This maps were created for the i-SoMPE project within EJP SOIL in 2021 and 2022. They were used to calculate various climatic variables for the characterization of the Agro-Environmental Zones (AEZ) of Europe and to assess the potential area of application of soil managament practices. The input data was long term average (1991 - 2020) climatic data (min. temp., max. temp., mean. temp., ET0, Prec.) for every day of the year for every Agri4Cast grid cell. We calculated 11 climatic variables: meanTemp: Mean annual temperature meanPrec: Mean annual precipitation sum meanET0: Mean annual potential evapotranspiration sum GrowSeason: Average length of the growing season (number of days per year with average temperature above 5°C) GrowSeason_class: Classification of the length of the growing season: < 200 days – short; 200 to 300 days – intermediate; >300 days – long (Metzger et al., 2012) TempSum :Average annual temperature sum (sum of all average daily temperatures above 0°C) TempSum_class: Classification of the temperature sum: < 2000 °C = cold; 2000 to 3000 °C = cool temperate; 3000 to 4000 °C = temperate; 4000 to 5000 °C = warm temperate; > 5000 °C = hot (Metzger et al., 2012) HeatDay: Average number of heat days (number of days per year with average maximal temperature above 30°C) FrostDay: Average number of frost days (number of days per year with average minimal temperature below 0°C) WaterBalance: Mean annual water balance (meanPrec – meanET0) DryDay: Average number of days per year with a negative water balance (Prec – ET0) Sources:Agri4Cast: https://agri4cast.jrc.ec.europa.eu/DataPortal/Index.aspx,Metzger et al., 2012: https://edepot.wur.nl/197197";image/tiff;46 European Countries (incl.
