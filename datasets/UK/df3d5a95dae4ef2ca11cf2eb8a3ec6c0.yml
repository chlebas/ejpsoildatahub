  title: Advanced soil geochemical atlas of England and Wales
  abstract: 'The Advanced Soil Geochemical Atlas of England and Wales was a joint
    project between the British Geological Survey and Rothamsted Research. The maps
    are based on 5700 surface soil samples (0-15cm), collected across England and
    Wales, that have been analysed for 52 major and trace elements. The soil samples
    collected for the National Soil Inventory (NSI)

    description: The concentrations of aluminium were determined using wavelength
      dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry with a lower limit of detection of
      0.05 % and typical coefficients of variation of around 3% for repeated analyses
      of certified reference materials. The coefficient of variation (CV) expresses
      the error associated with subsampling and analysis; CV values of less than around
      10 % suggest that analyses are reasonably accurate.
