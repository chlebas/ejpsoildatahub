  title: Cover Management factor (C-factor) for the EU
  abstract: 'This dataset (GIS map) (2015) represents the Cover Management factor
    (C-factor), one of the input layers when calculating the Universal Soil Loss Equation
    (USLE) model, which is the most frequently used model for soil erosion risk estimation;
    for EU28; resolution 100m. The C-factor was estimated for a) arable lands based
    on crop composition and for b) all other land uses (non-arable) based on the vegetation
    density and land cover type. The management practices (reduced tillage/no till,
    plant residues and winter cover crops) were taken into account in estimating C-factor
    in arable lands.
