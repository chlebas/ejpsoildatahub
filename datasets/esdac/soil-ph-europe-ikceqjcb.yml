  title: Soil pH in Europe
  abstract: 'A quantitative map of estimated soil pH values across Europe from a compilation
    of 12,333 soil pH measurements from 11 different sources, and using a geo-statistical
    framework based on Regression-Kriging. Fifty-four (54) auxiliary variables in
    the form of raster maps at 5km resolution were used to explain the differences
    in the distribution of soil pH (CaCl2) and the kriged map of the residuals from
    the regression model was added.
