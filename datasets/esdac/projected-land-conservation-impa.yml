  title: Projected Land Conservation Impacts on Global Soil Erosion and Pollination
    Sufficiency
  abstract: 'We combine the open-source land-system model MAgPIE (Model of Agricultural
    Production and its Impact on the Environment) with the Spatial Economic Allocation
    Landscape Simulator (SEALS) and the Global Soil Erosion Modelling (GloSEM) platform
    to assess how different land conservation measures focused on climate and biodiversity
    protection could drive changes in soil loss by water erosion, pollination and
    landscape heterogeneity.
