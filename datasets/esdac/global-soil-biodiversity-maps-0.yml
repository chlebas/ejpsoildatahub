  title: Global Soil Biodiversity Atlas Maps
  abstract: 'Dataset (2016) containing 2 GIS maps from the Global Soil Biodiversity
    Atlas: 1) the Soil Biodiversity map showing a simple index describing the potential
    level of diversity living in soils (with the use of two other datasets: distribution
    of microbial soil carbon used as a proxy for soil microbial diversity, and the
    distribution of the main groups of soil macrofauna used as a proxy for soil fauna
    diversity. 2) the Soil Biodiversity threats showing the potential rather than
    the actual level of threat to soil organisms. For the development of this map,
    a number of diverse threats and corresponding proxies were chosen.
