  abstract: 'This database (2004) is the only harmonized soil database for Europe,
    extending also to Eurasia. It contains a soil geographical database SGDBE (polygons)
    to which a number of essential soil attributes are attached, and an associate
    database PTRDB, with attributes which values have been derived through pedotransfer
    rules. Also part of the database is the Soil Profile Analytical Database, that
    contains measured and estimated soil profiles for Europe.
