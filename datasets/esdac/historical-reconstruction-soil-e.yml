  title: Historical reconstruction of soil erosion in Europe
  abstract: 'The past soil erosion rates have been reconstructed by applying the CE-DYNAM
    model. We have estimated annual losses by water erosion from 1860-2018; here,
    we present the average loss per decade (16 Geotiff files). The annual and monthly
    soil erosion reconstruction data (1860-2018) can be useful inputs for Earth System
    Models.
