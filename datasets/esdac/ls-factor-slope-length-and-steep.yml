  title: LS-factor (Slope Length and Steepness factor) for the EU
  abstract: 'This dataset (GIS maps) (2015) represents the Slope Length and Steepness
    factor (LS-factor), one of the six input layers when calculating the Universal
    Soil Loss Equation (USLE) model, which is the most frequently used model for soil
    erosion risk estimation; for EU28; maps at resolutions of 25m (per country) and
    100m (Europe-wide).
