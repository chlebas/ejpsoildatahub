  title: Global Soil Erodibility
  abstract: 'This dataset encompasses global soil erodibility (K) factor maps, with
    the K factor being estimated through the Wischmeier and Smith (1978) method. In
    addition, measured values of saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) have been
    incorporated into the original method to formulate the Ksat-based soil erodibility
    (Kksat factor) map. A third k-factor dataset which was included in the GloSEM
    (Borrelli et al., 2017) is also included.
