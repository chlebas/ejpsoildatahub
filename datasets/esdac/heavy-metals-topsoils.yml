  abstract: 'GIS Maps (2008) produced by mapping the concentrations of eight critical
    heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, mercury, nickel, lead and zinc)
    using the 1588 georeferenced topsoil samples from the FOREGS Geochemical database.
    The concentrations were interpolated using block regression-kriging over the 26
    European countries that contributed to the database.
