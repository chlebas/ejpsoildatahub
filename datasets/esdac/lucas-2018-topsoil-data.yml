  title: LUCAS 2018 TOPSOIL data
  abstract: 'Data from the 2018 LUCAS campaign soil component containing soil properties
    data for 18,984 samples: pH (CaCl2 and H2O), organic carbon content, CaCO3, nitrogen,
    phosphorous, potassium, EC (Electrical conductivity), Oxalate extractable Fe and
    Al .
    Soil dataset collected as part of the 2018 Land Use/Cover Area 
    frame statistical Survey’ (generally referred to as LUCAS Soil Module). It presents an 
    overview of the various laboratory analysis and describes the spatial variability of soil 
    properties by land cover (LC) class and a comparative analysis of the soil properties for 
    NUTS 2 regions.
    The LUCAS Soil Module is the only mechanism that currently provides a harmonised and 
    regular collection of soil data for the entire territory of the European Union, addressing all 
    major land cover types simultaneously, in a single sampling period (April – October).
    At the same time, the LUCAS Soil module can support further policy needs through a 
    flexibility that permits both the collection of new field data, if required, from new sampling 
    sites. In turn, this can be complemented with additional laboratory analysis (e.g. 
    micronutrients, specific pollutants).'
