  title: 3D Soil Hydraulic Database of Europe at 1 km and 250 m resolution
  abstract: 'A consistent spatial soil hydraulic database at 7 soil depths up to 2
    m calculated for Europe based on SoilGrids250m and 1 km datasets and pedotransfer
    functions trained on the European Hydropedological Data Inventory. Saturated water
    content, water content at field capacity and wilting point, saturated hydraulic
    conductivity and Mualem-van Genuchten parameters for the description of the moisture
    retention, and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curves have been predicted.
    The derived 3D soil hydraulic layers (EU-SoilHydroGrids ver1.0) can be used for
    environmental modelling purposes at catchment or continental scale in Europe.
    Currently, only EU-SoilHydroGrids provides information on the most frequently
    required soil hydraulic properties with full European coverage up to 2 m depth
    at 250 m resolution.
