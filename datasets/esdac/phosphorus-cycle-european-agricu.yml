  title: Phosphorus cycle in European agricultural soils
  abstract: 'Process-based biogeochemical models are valuable instruments to monitor
    the P cycle and predict the effect of agricultural management policies. We upscale
    the calibrated DayCent model at European level using data-derived soil properties,
    advanced input data sets, and representative management practices. Available datasets
    include Current P Budget and Soil Pools, Projected P Budget and Soil Pools for
    the EU and UK as well the datasets corresponding to the figures of the related
    manuscript.
