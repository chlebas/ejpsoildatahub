  title: Post-fire soil erosion map for Portugal
  abstract: 'This dataset contains the results of a study that mapped post-fire soil
    erosion in Portugal and identified the areas with higher post-fire erosion risk
    for past and future climate extremes. Two maps are provided: one at 100m resolution
    and another at 25m resolution. The maps express predicted soil losses (Mg ha-1
    y-1).
