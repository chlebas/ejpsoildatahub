  title: Topsoil Soil Organic Carbon (LUCAS) for EU25
  abstract: 'This dataset (2015) provides maps for Topsoil Soil Organic Carbon in
    EU-25 that are based on LUCAS 2009 soil poibnt data through a generalized additive
    model. Map of predicted topsoil organic carbon content (g C kg-1) : The map of
    predicted topsoil organic carbon content (g C kg-1) was produced by fitting a
    generalised additive model between organic carbon measurements from the LUCAS
    survey (dependent variable) and a set of selected environmental covariates; namely
    slope, land cover, annual accumulated temperature, net primary productivity, latitude
    and longitude. It also includes a Map of standard error of the OC model predictions
    (g C kg-1).
