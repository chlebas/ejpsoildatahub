  title: Multiple co-occurring erosion processes on global cropland
  abstract: 'Novel assessment of the spatial distribution of individual and combined
    (additive) threat to soil due to five erosion processes across the world''s areas
    suitable for farming. Susceptibility classes were predicted for water erosion,
    wind erosion, Soil Loss by Crop Harvesting (SLCH), Tillage erosion and gully erosion.
