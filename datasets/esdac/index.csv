3d-soil-hydraulic-database-europe-1-km-and-250-m-resolution;3D Soil Hydraulic Database of Europe at 1 km and 250 m resolution;A consistent spatial soil hydraulic database at 7 soil depths up to 2 m calculated for Europe based on SoilGrids250m and 1 km datasets and pedotransfer functions trained on the European Hydropedological Data Inventory. Saturated water content, water content at field capacity and wilting point, saturated hydraulic conductivity and Mualem-van Genuchten parameters for the description of the moisture retention, and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curves have been predicted. The derived 3D soil hydraulic layers (EU-SoilHydroGrids ver1.0) can be used for environmental modelling purposes at catchment or continental scale in Europe. Currently, only EU-SoilHydroGrids provides information on the most frequently required soil hydraulic properties with full European coverage up to 2 m depth at 250 m resolution.;2017;https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/public_path//datainventoryitem_img/ths.JPG;Datasets;Soil Functions Data;;https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/node/49322;

Map of predicted topsoil organic carbon content (g C kg-1) : The map of predicted topsoil organic carbon content (g C kg-1) was produced by fitting a generalised additive model between organic carbon measurements from the LUCAS survey (dependent variable) and a set of selected environmental covariates; namely slope, land cover, annual accumulated temperature, net primary productivity, latitude and longitude. It also includes a Map of standard error of the OC model predictions (g C kg-1).";2014;https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/public_path//datainventoryitem_img/LUCASSOC.png;Datasets;Soil Threats Data;;https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/node/34383;European Commission Joint Research Centre
