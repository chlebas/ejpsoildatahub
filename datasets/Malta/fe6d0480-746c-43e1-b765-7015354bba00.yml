    description: "In Malta the spatial pattern of soil types is very intricate, both\
      \ in semi-natural and agricultural areas and different soil types often occur\
      \ within a single field or within a distance of few metres. In the recent national\
      \ soil inventory of the Maltese Islands (MALSIS), soils were described according\
      \ to the criteria of the World Reference Base for Soil Resources. Seven major\
      \ soil reference groups were identified: Leptosols, Vertisols, Calcisols, Luvisols,\
      \ Cambisols, Regosols and Arenosols. Key to abbreviationsN  -  Semi-naturalClf\
