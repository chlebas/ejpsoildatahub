The profiles were carried out between 1960 and 1999 during the making of the soil map of Slovenia in 1:25.000. Soil profiles were updated in 2015 so currently there is 1879 soil profiles. Each soil profile contains the data about soil type (by the Slovenian soil classification system: ), year of excavation, location (x and y coordinates by national D48 CRS), elevation, slope, exposition, land use, type of parent material). 
Soil profile table relates to attached soil horizon data which contains 5440 soil horizons with the data about soil profile ID, type of horizon, upper and lower depth of horizon (in cm), color (by Munsell), coarse material in the horizon, as well as some measured soil parameters such as soil pH, soil texture parameters, phosphorus, potassium, organic matter, and organic content, nitrogen, C/N ratio, CEC (cation exchange capacity).";;;;;
