  abstract: "COS was made in 1995 and has been updated several times. COS is a mapping\
    \ of polygons, representing units of occupation/use of the homogeneous soil. Land\
    \ occupation/use unit means any area of terrain greater than or equal to the defined\
    \ minimum cartographic unit (1 ha) with distance between lines \u2265 to 20 m\
    \ and the % of a given class of land occupation/use is \u2265 75% of the total\
    \ area (Caetano et al., 2010). \n"
