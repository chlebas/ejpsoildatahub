# SOILS4MED

SOIL health monitoring and information systems FOR
sustainable soil management in the MEDiterranean region.

SOILS4MED has the following objectives: 

1) engage with stakeholders in line with the
Living Lab approach and raise awareness on the benefits deriving from increased
investment in soil data and information (SDI);
2) develop policy relevant integrated indicator sets and monitoring protocols adapted to the environmental specificities and
stakeholder needs of the Mediterranean Region;
3) validate the protocols in study
areas representing major agro-ecological regions and soil types, generating the first
region-wide harmonized soil health dataset for the Mediterranean Region;
4) demonstrate the capacity of the SDI produced by the protocols, integrated by legacy soil
data, to feed state-of-the-art tools to support sustainable soil and water management,
land degradation neutrality, and to en-hance regional soil condition mapping including carbon stock mapping; and
5) design and implement standardized country-based
soil information systems (SIS) for the effective management and use of SDI.
