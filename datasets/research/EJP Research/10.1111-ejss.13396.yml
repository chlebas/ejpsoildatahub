  title: The importance of biochar quality and pyrolysis yield for soil carbon sequestration
    in practice
  abstract: "<title>Abstract</title><p>Biochar is a carbon (C)\u2010rich material\
    \ produced from biomass by anoxic or oxygen\u2010limited thermal treatment known\
    \ as pyrolysis. Despite substantial gaseous losses of C during pyrolysis, incorporating\
    \ biochar in soil has been suggested as an effective long\u2010term option to\
    \ sequester CO<sub>2</sub> for climate change mitigation, due to the intrinsic\
    \ stability of biochar C. However, no universally applicable approach that combines\
    \ biochar quality and pyrolysis yield into an overall metric of C sequestration\
    \ efficiency has been suggested yet. To ensure safe environmental use of biochar\
    \ in agricultural soils, the International Biochar Initiative and the European\
    \ Biochar Certificate have developed guidelines on biochar quality. In both guidelines,\
    \ the hydrogen\u2010to\u2010organic C (H/C<sub>org</sub>) ratio is an important\
    \ quality criterion widely used as a proxy of biochar stability, which has been\
    \ recognized also in the new EU regulation 2021/2088. Here, we evaluate the biochar\
    \ C sequestration efficiency from published data that comply with the biochar\
    \ quality criteria in the above guidelines, which may regulate future large\u2010\
    scale field application in practice. The sequestration efficiency is calculated\
    \ from the fraction of biochar C remaining in soil after 100\u2009years (F<sub>perm</sub>)\
    \ and the C\u2010yield of various feedstocks pyrolyzed at different temperatures.\
    \ Both parameters are expressed as a function of H/C<sub>org</sub>. Combining\
    \ these two metrics is relevant for assessing the mitigation potential of the\
    \ biochar economy. We find that the C sequestration efficiency for stable biochar\
    \ is in the range of 25%\u201350% of feedstock C. It depends on the type of feedstock\
    \ and is in general a non\u2010linear function of H/C<sub>org</sub>. We suggest\
    \ that for plant\u2010based feedstock, biochar production that achieves H/C<sub>org</sub>\
    \ of 0.38\u20130.44, corresponding to pyrolysis temperatures of 500\u2013550\xB0\
    C, is the most efficient in terms of soil carbon sequestration. Such biochars\
    \ reveal an average sequestration efficiency of 41.4% (\xB14.5%) over 100\u2009\
    years.</p>"
