  title: 'Soil and crop management practices and the water regulation functions of
    soils: a qualitative synthesis of meta-analyses relevant to European agriculture'
  abstract: "<p>Abstract. Adopting soil and crop management practices that conserve\
    \ or enhance soil structure is critical for supporting the sustainable adaptation\
    \ of agriculture to climate change, as it should help maintain agricultural production\
    \ in the face of increasing drought or water excess without impairing environmental\
    \ quality. In this paper, we evaluate the evidence for this assertion by synthesizing\
    \ the results of 34 published meta-analyses of the effects of such practices on\
    \ soil physical and hydraulic properties relevant for climate change adaptation\
    \ in European agriculture. We also review an additional 127 meta-analyses that\
    \ investigated synergies and trade-offs or help to explain the effects of soil\
    \ and crop management in terms of the underlying processes and mechanisms. Finally,\
    \ we identify how responses to alternative soil\u2013crop management systems vary\
    \ under contrasting agro-environmental conditions across Europe. This information\
    \ may help practitioners and policymakers to draw context-specific conclusions\
    \ concerning the efficacy of management practices as climate adaptation tools.\
    \ Our synthesis demonstrates that organic soil amendments and the adoption of\
    \ practices that maintain \u201Ccontinuous living cover\u201D result in significant\
    \ benefits for the water regulation function of soils, mostly arising from the\
    \ additional carbon inputs to soil and the stimulation of biological processes.\
    \ These effects are clearly related to improved soil aggregation and enhanced\
    \ bio-porosity, both of which reduce surface runoff and increase infiltration.\
    \ One potentially negative consequence of these systems is a reduction in soil\
    \ water storage and groundwater recharge, which may be problematic in dry climates.\
    \ Some important synergies are reductions in nitrate leaching to groundwater and\
    \ greenhouse gas emissions for nonleguminous cover crop systems. The benefits\
    \ of reducing tillage intensity appear much less clear-cut. Increases in soil\
    \ bulk density due to traffic compaction are commonly reported. However, biological\
    \ activity is enhanced under reduced tillage intensity, which should improve soil\
    \ structure and infiltration capacity and reduce surface runoff and the losses\
    \ of agro-chemicals to surface water. However, the evidence for these beneficial\
    \ effects is inconclusive, while significant trade-offs include yield penalties\
    \ and increases in greenhouse gas emissions and the risks of leaching of pesticides\
    \ and nitrate. Our synthesis also highlights important knowledge gaps on the effects\
    \ of management practices on root growth and transpiration. Thus, conclusions\
    \ related to the impacts of management on the crop water supply and other water\
    \ regulation functions are necessarily based on inferences derived from proxy\
    \ variables. Based on these knowledge gaps, we outlined several key avenues for\
    \ future research on this topic.\n                    </p>"
