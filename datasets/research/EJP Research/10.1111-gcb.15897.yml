  title: "Achievable agricultural soil carbon sequestration across Europe from country\u2010\
    specific estimates"
  abstract: "<title>Abstract</title><p>The role of soils in the global carbon cycle\
    \ and in reducing GHG emissions from agriculture has been increasingly acknowledged.\
    \ The \u20184 per 1000\u2019 (4p1000) initiative has become a prominent action\
    \ plan for climate change mitigation and achieve food security through an annual\
    \ increase in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks by 0.4%, (i.e. 4\u2030 per year).\
    \ However, the feasibility of the 4p1000 scenario and, more generally, the capacity\
    \ of individual countries to implement soil carbon sequestration (SCS) measures\
    \ remain highly uncertain. Here, we evaluated country\u2010specific SCS potentials\
    \ of agricultural land for 24 countries in Europe. Based on a detailed survey\
    \ of available literature, we estimate that between 0.1% and 27% of the agricultural\
    \ greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can potentially be compensated by SCS annually\
    \ within the next decades. Measures varied widely across countries, indicating\
    \ differences in country\u2010specific environmental conditions and agricultural\
    \ practices. None of the countries' SCS potential reached the aspirational goal\
    \ of the 4p1000 initiative, suggesting that in order to achieve this goal, a wider\
    \ range of measures and implementation pathways need to be explored. Yet, SCS\
    \ potentials exceeded those from previous pan\u2010European modelling scenarios,\
    \ underpinning the general need to include national/regional knowledge and expertise\
    \ to improve estimates of SCS potentials. The complexity of the chosen SCS measurement\
    \ approaches between countries ranked from tier 1 to tier 3 and included the effect\
    \ of different controlling factors, suggesting that methodological improvements\
    \ and standardization of SCS accounting are urgently required. Standardization\
    \ should include the assessment of key controlling factors such as realistic areas,\
    \ technical and practical feasibility, trade\u2010offs with other GHG and climate\
    \ change. Our analysis suggests that country\u2010specific knowledge and SCS estimates\
    \ together with improved data sharing and harmonization are crucial to better\
    \ quantify the role of soils in offsetting anthropogenic GHG emissions at global\
    \ level.</p>"
