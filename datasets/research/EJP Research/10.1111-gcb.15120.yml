  title: Changes in soil organic carbon under perennial crops
  abstract: "<title>Abstract</title><p>This study evaluates the dynamics of soil organic\
    \ carbon (SOC) under perennial crops across the globe. It quantifies the effect\
    \ of change from annual to perennial crops and the subsequent temporal changes\
    \ in SOC stocks during the perennial crop cycle. It also presents an empirical\
    \ model to estimate changes in the SOC content under crops as a function of time,\
    \ land use, and site characteristics. We used a harmonized global dataset containing\
    \ paired\u2010comparison empirical values of SOC and different types of perennial\
    \ crops (perennial grasses, palms, and woody plants) with different end uses:\
    \ bioenergy, food, other bio\u2010products, and short rotation coppice. Salient\
    \ outcomes include: a 20\u2010year period encompassing a change from annual to\
    \ perennial crops led to an average 20% increase in SOC at 0\u201330\_cm (6.0\_\
    \xB1\_4.6\_Mg/ha gain) and a total 10% increase over the 0\u2013100\_cm soil profile\
    \ (5.7\_\xB1\_10.9\_Mg/ha). A change from natural pasture to perennial crop decreased\
    \ SOC stocks by 1% over 0\u201330\_cm (\u22122.5\_\xB1\_4.2\_Mg/ha) and 10% over\
    \ 0\u2013100\_cm (\u221213.6\_\xB1\_8.9\_Mg/ha). The effect of a land use change\
    \ from forest to perennial crops did not show significant impacts, probably due\
    \ to the limited number of plots; but the data indicated that while a 2% increase\
    \ in SOC was observed at 0\u201330\_cm (16.81\_\xB1\_55.1\_Mg/ha), a decrease\
    \ in 24% was observed at 30\u2013100\_cm (\u221240.1\_\xB1\_16.8\_Mg/ha). Perennial\
    \ crops generally accumulate SOC through time, especially woody crops; and temperature\
    \ was the main driver explaining differences in SOC dynamics, followed by crop\
    \ age, soil bulk density, clay content, and depth. We present empirical evidence\
    \ showing that the FAO <italic>perennialization</italic> strategy is reasonable,\
    \ underscoring the role of perennial crops as a useful component of climate change\
    \ mitigation strategies.</p>"
