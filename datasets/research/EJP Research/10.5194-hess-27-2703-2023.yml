  title: 'Impacts of soil management and climate on saturated and near-saturated hydraulic
    conductivity: analyses of the Open Tension-disk Infiltrometer Meta-database (OTIM)'
  abstract: "<p>Abstract. Saturated and near-saturated soil hydraulic conductivities\_\
    Kh (mm\u2009h\u22121) determine the partitioning of precipitation into surface\
    \ runoff and infiltration and are fundamental to soils' susceptibility to preferential\
    \ flow. Recent studies found indications that climate factors influence\_Kh, which\
    \ is highly relevant in the face of climate change. In this study, we investigated\
    \ relationships\nbetween pedoclimatic factors and\_Kh and also evaluated effects\
    \ of land use and soil management. To this end, we collated the Open Tension-disk\
    \ Infiltrometer Meta-database (OTIM), which contains 1297 individual data entries\
    \ from 172\_different publication sources. We analysed a spectrum of saturated\
    \ and near-saturated hydraulic conductivities at matric potentials between\_0\
    \ and 100\u2009mm. We found that methodological details like the direction of\
    \ the wetting sequence or the choice of method for calculating infiltration rates\
    \ to hydraulic conductivities had a large impact on the results. We therefore\
    \ restricted ourselves to a subset of\_466 of the 1297 data entries with similar\
    \ methodological approaches. Correlations between\_Ks and\_Kh at higher supply\
    \ tensions decreased especially close to saturation, indicating a different flow\
    \ mechanism at and very close to saturation than towards the dry end of the investigated\
    \ tension range. Climate factors were better correlated with topsoil near-saturated\
    \ hydraulic conductivities at supply tensions \u2265\u200930\u2009mm than soil\
    \ texture, bulk density and organic carbon content. We find it most likely that\
    \ the climate variables are proxies for soil macropore networks created by the\
    \ respective biological activity, pedogenesis and climate-specific land use and\
    \ management choices. Due to incomplete documentation in the source publications\
    \ of OTIM, we were able to investigate only a few land use types and agricultural\
    \ management practices. Land use, tillage system and soil compaction significantly\
    \ influenced\_Kh, with effect sizes appearing comparable to the ones of soil texture\
    \ and soil organic carbon. The data in OTIM show that experimental bias is present,\
    \ introduced by the choice of measurement time relative to soil tillage, experimental\
    \ design or data evaluation procedures. The establishment of best-practice rules\
    \ for tension-disk infiltrometer measurements would therefore be helpful. Future\
    \ studies are needed to investigate how climate shapes soil macropore networks\
    \ and how land use and management can be adapted to improve soil hydraulic properties.\
    \ Both tasks require large numbers of new measurement data with improved documentation\
    \ on soil biology and land use and management history.\n                    </p>"
