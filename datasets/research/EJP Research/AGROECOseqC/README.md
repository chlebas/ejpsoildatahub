## Aim:	

By studying the main actors involved in main biogeochemical processes, AGROECOseqC challenge is to investigate the underlying mechanisms promoting the synchrony between plant demand and nutrient supply by soil microbiome, with the aim to build sustainable agricultural systems where plant, soil fauna and microbial diversity are key drivers to reduce nutrient losses, GHG emission, and increase C sequestration in soil.

## Keywords:	

Plant diversity, soil fauna, soil microbiome diversity, plant-soil biota interaction, plant demand-microbial supply synchrony, soil carbon and nutrient fluxes, carbon : nutrient coupling, SOC storage, GHG emission
