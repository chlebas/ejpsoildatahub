  title: "The Response of Retisol\u2019s Carbon Storage Potential to Various Organic\
    \ Matter Inputs"
  abstract: "<p>Organic carbon sequestration and its quality in soil is a crucial\
    \ aspect in maintaining the productivity of the soil and the whole ecosystem.\
    \ The study examined the changes in soil organic carbon (SOC), its sequestration\
    \ potential, and the mean effect size under various long-term organic matter inputs\
    \ in acid soil (Dystric Retisol). Cattle manure (CM 60 t ha\u22121) and various\
    \ plant residues were used for the fertilization of acid and limed soil. The following\
    \ treatments were included in the experimental design: (1) natural Retisol; (2)\
    \ natural Retisol + CM; (3) natural Retisol + various plant residues; (4) calcium\
    \ carbonate (CaCO3) at a 1.0 rate every five years); (5) CaCO3 + CM; (6) CaCO3\
    \ + various plant residues. The data demonstrated that the treatments including\
    \ the use of organic material (CM and various plant residues) showed a greater\
    \ SOC content accumulation with a storage of up to 0.2\u20130.6% more carbon in\
    \ the topsoil. Alternative organic fertilizers had a detrimental impact when applied\
    \ to unlimed soil, with a loss of 0.59 g kg\u22121 C per year. All the fertilization\
    \ treatments significantly increased the SOC level with the mean effect size of\
    \ 0.02\u20130.28, and the increase varied from 1.89% to 32.89%. This result suggested\
    \ that liming, together with organic fertilizers, proved to be a relatively efficient\
    \ approach to improving the soil\u2019s health and quality.</p>"
