  title: QBS-ar and QBS-ar_BF index toolbox for biodiversity assessment of microarthropods
    community in soil
  abstract: "This toolbox contains a proposal and detailed instructions for the standardization\
    \ of the QBS-ar index procedure. The QBS-ar index (Parisi, 2001; Parisi et al.,\
    \ 2005) is an index aimed at assessing soil-dwelling microarthropod communities\
    \ in relation to their soil adaptation. The core of QBS-ar index principle is:\
    \ the higher is soil quality, the higher will be the number of microarthropod\
    \ groups well adapted to soil habitats living there. Soil quality here stands\
    \ for good stability, high organic matter content, and good biodiversity level.\
    \ Worth of notice, QBS-ar is not comprehensive of the whole soil biodiversity\
    \ or whole soil quality. For each sample to be assessed with the QBS-ar method,\
    \ three different samplings are performed 5-10 meters apart (Menta et al., 2018),\
    \ obtaining three subsamples that are considered representative of an area homogeneous\
    \ for slope and vegetation. 1-page guidelines for sampling and extraction were\
    \ detailed in file <strong>\u20181.QBS-ar sampling and extraction guidelines.pdf\u2019\
    </strong>. The functional characteristics for soil adaptation of microarthropods\
    \ are the reduction of visual structures as microphthalmia or even anophthalmia,\
    \ the reduction or loss of pigmentation and dehydration adaptations (thinner cuticle,\
    \ shorter setas or chaeta loss), appendage reduction (as shorter and/or smaller\
    \ antennae, legs, furca), miniaturization, streamlined body form. Starting from\
    \ these principles, soil organisms could be divided into a discrete set of Biological\
    \ Forms (BFs, eco-morpho-types) according to their morphological adaptation to\
    \ soil (Menta et al., 2018); in the EXCALIBUR and EJP-Minotaur projects, CREA\
    \ Research Centre for Agriculture and Environment, in collaboration with the National\
    \ QBS-ar working group (D\u2019Avino et al., 2021), recognized no less than 54\
    \ different BFs, 16 of which were classified as less frequent. Each BF is shortly\
    \ described and associated with a score, the so-called Eco-Morphological Index\
    \ (EMI), which ranges from 1 to 20 in proportion to the increasing degree of the\
    \ soil adaptation of microarthropods. As reported by Parisi et al. (2005), some\
    \ taxa show only one single EMI value because all species belonging to these taxa\
    \ report the same adaptation level to the soil. Other groups show a range of EMIs\
    \ in relation to the different adaptation levels of species to the soil. In general,\
    \ eu-edaphic forms get EMI = 20, hemi-edaphic get an EMI rating proportionate\
    \ to their degree of soil adaptation, while epedaphic (epigean) forms get EMI\
    \ score = 1 (Menta et al., 2018). In QBS-ar whenever two eco-morphological forms\
    \ are present in the same group, the final score is determined by the higher EMI.\
    \ In other words, the most highly adapted microarthropods belonging to a group\
    \ determine the overall EMI score for that group (Parisi et al 2005). This statement\
    \ is not valid for the QBS-ar_BF proposed here, for which every biological form\
    \ concurs to the calculation of QBS-ar_BF index, regardless of whether or not\
    \ it belongs to the same group (i.e. class or order). Moreover, to assess variability\
    \ between subsamples an index based on spectral analysis (D\u2019Avino, 2019)\
    \ is proposed. The file <strong>\u20182.Sheet for QBS-ar record and calculation_v2.xlsx\u2019\
    </strong> provides the selection of 54 most common BFs in European soils and should\
    \ be used as a template for data registration during the microarthropods identification\
    \ and count at the stereomicroscope. As outlined in the \u201CREADME\u201D sheet\
    \ of the excel file, the user should register the abundance of each BF and other\
    \ sampling-related information, and the template will automatically perform a\
    \ series of calculations and will format several output sheets. In particular\
    \ it calculates: mean abundance of microarthropods and relative class of abundance,\
    \ QBS-ar, QBS-ar_BF, variability index community based on spectral analysis. One\
    \ example of the compilated sheet is reported as file <strong>\u20182a.Filled_template_example_v2.pdf\u2019\
    </strong>. The sampling was carried out during MINOTAUR project, the example was\
    \ implemented starting from file <strong>\u20182. Sheet for QBS-ar record and\
    \ calculation.xlsx\u2019</strong>. The collection, merging and organization of\
    \ data from the precompiled sheet could be a cumbersome task, especially for surveys\
    \ with many different samples. The user would need to copy-paste each row in the\
    \ \u201CExport_Sample\u201D or \u201CExport_Subsample\u201D sheets (from file\
    \ 2.) to a new file, to perform overall analysis; an error-prone operation. To\
    \ ease this process, we have compiled a short R script that can be found in this\
    \ submission as the third file <strong>\u20183.QBS-ar data merging_v2.R\u2019\
    </strong>. By using the script, the user would automatically obtain three files\
    \ (csv and/or xlsx, that will be stored in a \u201CResults\u201D folder) resulting\
    \ from the merging of any number of QBS precompiled templates collected in a folder:\
    \ 1. The result of the merge of \u201CExport_Sample\u201D sheets 2. The result\
    \ of the merge of \u201CExport_Subsample\u201D sheets 3. The result of the merge\
    \ of \"Export_MINOTAUR\" sheets Cited reference D\u2019Avino, L., Menta, C., Jacomini,\
