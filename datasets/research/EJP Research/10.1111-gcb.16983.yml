  abstract: "<title>Abstract</title><p>The term <italic>carbon (C) sequestration</italic>\
    \ has not just become a buzzword but is something of a siren's call to scientific\
    \ communicators and media outlets. <italic>Carbon sequestration</italic> is the\
    \ removal of C from the atmosphere and the storage, for example, in soil. It has\
    \ the potential to partially compensate for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions\
    \ and is, therefore, an important piece in the global climate change mitigation\
    \ puzzle. However, the term <italic>C sequestration</italic> is often used misleadingly\
    \ and, while likely unintentional, can lead to the perpetuation of biased conclusions\
    \ and exaggerated expectations about its contribution to climate change mitigation\
    \ efforts. Soils have considerable potential to take up C but many are also in\
    \ a state of continuous loss. In such soils, measures to build up soil C may only\
    \ lead to a reduction in C losses (C loss mitigation) rather than result in real\
    \ C sequestration and negative emissions. In an examination of 100 recent peer\u2010\
    reviewed papers on topics surrounding soil C, only 4% were found to have used\
    \ the term <italic>C sequestration</italic> correctly. Furthermore, 13% of the\
    \ papers equated C sequestration with C stocks. The review, further, revealed\
    \ that measures leading to C sequestration will not always result in climate change\
    \ mitigation when non\u2010CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse gases and leakage are taken\
    \ into consideration. This paper highlights potential pitfalls when using the\
    \ term <italic>C sequestration</italic> incorrectly and calls for accurate usage\
    \ of this term going forward. Revised and new terms are suggested to distinguish\
    \ clearly between C sequestration in soils, SOC loss mitigation, negative emissions,\
    \ climate change mitigation, SOC storage, and SOC accrual to avoid miscommunication\
    \ among scientists and stakeholder groups in future.</p>"
