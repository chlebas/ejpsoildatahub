10.5281/zenodo.6510954;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6510954;Adoption rate of 58 innovative soil management practices;Frederic Vanwindekens,f.vanwindekens@cra.wallonie.be;May 2, 2022;"The dataset is based on survey national experts in soil sciences. The survey aimed, among other, to identify the current level of adoption of a list of 58 soil management practices in the different countries and Environmental Zones across Europe of partners countries or regions, following the classification of Rogers (2003). In detail, five qualitative classes were defined: - only by a few farmers (e.g., the innovators) (approx. < 2.5% of farmers) - by the early adopters (approx. < 16% of farmers) - by an early majority (approx. < 50% of farmers) - by a late majority (approx. <84% of farmers) - by all farmers (approx. 100% of farmers) The list of 58 soil management practices was established in a preliminary inventory done in the framework of i-SoMPE : A preliminary list of well-documented Soil Management Practices (SMPs) was set up by reviewing published articles and reports from specific European Research projects, also including deliverables from the EJP SOIL programme. A preliminary check of the type and characteristics of each of SMPs was done in order to avoid to repeat twice the same practice in the inventory list of SMPs. After completing the preliminary check, a total of 58 SMPs were selected and briefly described. According to the EJP SOIL classification, they were grouped in 7 land management categories as follows: - agricultural systems, - buffer strips and small landscape elements, - crop protection, - crops and crop rotations, - organic matter and nutrient management,  - tillage and trafic, - water management The data were processed and crossed with the shapefiles of the agroecological zones (AEZ) for producing maps of adoption (!! not based on statistics). These maps are published in the report and will be shared online in image files in the i-SoMPE Community on Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/communities/i-sompe/?page=1&size=20) and through an public web application References, Rogers, Everett M. 2003.

This dataset contains information to characterize the agroecological zones (AEZ) of Europe on 4 spatial levels. The data was calculated by an R project available on GitLab (https://gitlab.com/heoi/i-sompe-wp1) using various data on land use, climate, soil characteristics and slope. More information on the data can be found in the report of the i-SoMPE project. The dataset contains the following files: - 1 ZIP-Folder with a shapefile of the AEZs used in i-SoMPE and described in the dataset - 1 XLSX file with information on all 4 spatial levels - 4 CSV files with information on 1 of 4 spatial levels - 1 XLSX file that contains information on the attributes described in the dataset";vnd.shp;46 European Countries (incl.

They were used to calculate various climatic variables for the characterization of the Agro-Environmental Zones (AEZ) of Europe and to assess the potential area of application of soil managament practices. The input data was long term average (1991 - 2020) climatic data (min. temp., max. temp., mean. temp., ET0, Prec.) for every day of the year for every Agri4Cast grid cell. We calculated 11 climatic variables: meanTemp: Mean annual temperature meanPrec: Mean annual precipitation sum meanET0: Mean annual potential evapotranspiration sum GrowSeason: Average length of the growing season (number of days per year with average temperature above 5C) GrowSeason_class: Classification of the length of the growing season: < 200 days short; 200 to 300 days intermediate; >300 days long (Metzger et al., 2012) TempSum :Average annual temperature sum (sum of all average daily temperatures above 0C) TempSum_class: Classification of the temperature sum: < 2000 C = cold; 2000 to 3000 C = cool temperate; 3000 to 4000 C = temperate; 4000 to 5000 C = warm temperate; > 5000 C = hot (Metzger et al., 2012) HeatDay: Average number of heat days (number of days per year with average maximal temperature above 30C) FrostDay: Average number of frost days (number of days per year with average minimal temperature below 0C) WaterBalance: Mean annual water balance (meanPrec meanET0) DryDay: Average number of days per year with a negative water balance (Prec ET0) Sources: Agri4Cast: https://agri4cast.jrc.ec.europa.eu/DataPortal/Index.aspx Metzger et al., 2012: https://edepot.wur.nl/197197";image/tiff;46 European Countries (incl.
