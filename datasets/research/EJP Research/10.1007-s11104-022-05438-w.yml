  title: The potential of cover crops to increase soil organic carbon storage in German
    croplands
  abstract: "<title>Abstract</title><sec>\n                <title>Aims</title>\n \
    \               <p>Soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks of croplands can be enhanced\
    \ by targeted management, which boosts soil fertility and contributes to climate\_\
    change mitigation. One SOC sequestration option is adopting cover crops. The aim\
    \ of this study was to quantify the SOC sequestration potential of cover crops\
    \ in Germany.</p>\n              </sec><sec>\n                <title>Methods</title>\n\
    \                <p>We simulated SOC scenarios on 1,267 cropland sites with site-specific\
    \ management data using an SOC model ensemble consisting of RothC and C-TOOL.\
    \ A new method was developed to estimate carbon input from cover crops that included\
    \ the effects of climate, sowing date and species on cover crop biomass production.</p>\n\
    \              </sec><sec>\n                <title>Results</title>\n         \
    \       <p>The recent cover crop area could be tripled to 30% of arable land in\
    \ Germany. This would enhance total carbon input by 12% and increase SOC stocks\
    \ by 35 Tg within 50 years, corresponding to an annual increase of 0.06 Mg C ha<sup>-1</sup>,\
    \ 2.5 Tg CO<sub>2</sub> or 0.8 per mill of current SOC stocks in 0\u201330\_cm\
    \ depth. On sites with cover crops, 0.28\u20130.33 Mg C ha<sup>-1</sup> a<sup>-1</sup>\
    \ would be accumulated within 50 years. Our simulations predicted that even if\
    \ the full potential for cover crop growth were realised, there would still be\
    \ a decline in SOC stocks in German croplands within 50 years due to the underlining\
    \ negative SOC trend.</p>\n              </sec><sec>\n                <title>Conclusions</title>\n\
    \                <p>Cover crops alone cannot turn croplands from carbon sources\
    \ to sinks. However, growing them reduces bare fallow periods and SOC losses and\
    \ thus is an effective climate change mitigation strategy in agriculture.</p>\n\
