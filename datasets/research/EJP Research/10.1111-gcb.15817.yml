  title: "Predicting ecosystem responses by data\u2010driven reciprocal modelling"
  abstract: "<title>Abstract</title><p>Treatment effects are traditionally quantified\
    \ in controlled experiments. However, experimental control is often achieved at\
    \ the expense of representativeness. Here, we present a data\u2010driven reciprocal\
    \ modelling framework to quantify the individual effects of environmental treatments\
    \ under field conditions. The framework requires a representative survey data\
    \ set describing the treatment (A or B), its responding target variable and other\
    \ environmental properties that cause variability of the target within the region\
    \ or population studied. A machine learning model is trained to predict the target\
    \ only based on observations in group A. This model is then applied to group B,\
    \ with predictions restricted to the model's space of applicability. The resulting\
    \ residuals represent case\u2010specific effect size estimates and thus provide\
    \ a quantification of treatment effects. This paper illustrates the new concept\
    \ of such data\u2010driven reciprocal modelling to estimate spatially explicit\
    \ effects of land\u2010use change on organic carbon stocks in European agricultural\
    \ soils. For many environmental treatments, the proposed concept can provide accurate\
    \ effect size estimates that are more representative than could feasibly ever\
    \ be achieved with controlled experiments.</p>"
