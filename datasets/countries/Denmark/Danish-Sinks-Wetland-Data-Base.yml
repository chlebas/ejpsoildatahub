  title: Change in Peat Coverage in Danish Cultivated Soils During the Past 35 Years
  abstract: 'Soil properties measured on soil cores extracted from predefined depth
    intervals with a 5-cm hand auger. Data includes an evaluation of the quality of
    each core. Covers historic areas with organic soils. Sampling intervals,0 - 30
    cm, 34 - 64 cm, 68 - 98 cm, 102 - 132 cm.
