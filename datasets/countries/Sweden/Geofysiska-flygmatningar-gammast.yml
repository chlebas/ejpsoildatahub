  title: "Airborne geophysical measurements"
  abstract: 'Flyggeophysics is a collective term for geophysical measurements carried out from aircraft or helicopter. Depending on the measurement method, the Flyggeophysical measurements may show the properties of the bedrock and soils from the ground surface down to several kilometers depth. The information collected is an important basis in, among other things, bedrock mapping, mineral exploration and community planning.SGU has been running Flyggeophysical measurements since 1960 and today there is information on large parts of the country. In our map show you can study the magnetic field, gravity or gamma radiation in Sweden.'
