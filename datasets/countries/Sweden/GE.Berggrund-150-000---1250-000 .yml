  abstract: 'SGU''s bedrock data provides both an overview of Sweden''s bedrock and two -dimensional models of the upper surface of the bedrock, which describe important properties of identified geological units, their geometry, the material that builds up the units and geological events they have undergone. This is one of very many maps and datsets that are available through “The Geological Survey of Sweden – SGU”. Their products are available from this website: https://www.sgu.se/en/products/ . However, some products are only available at the Swedish version of the site (as for example this one). '
