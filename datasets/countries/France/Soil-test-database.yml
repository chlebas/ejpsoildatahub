  abstract: |
    We have included the statistical processing chain from The Earth Analysis Database (BDAT) program in the broader
    context of the decision-making architecture of the soils information system. The first type of information produced
    corresponds to the mapping of the statistical distributions of soil properties. To do this, the analysis results are
    aggregated at the spatial and temporal levels by grouping them at a coarser grain than the municipality (regions,
    departments, cantons and small agricultural regions) and according to a calculation time period that is set at 5
    years for time-varying parameters such as organic carbon, and 20 years for more stable parameters such as clay content.
    A set of statistical parameters on the distribution of soil properties within the spatio-temporal unit is calculated
    on these sub-populations: number of determinations, mean, standard deviation, deciles for ordinal properties, values â€‹
    of the dominant and secondary class for cardinal properties. The second type of information stored corresponds to the
    temporal comparison of the sub-populations of the spatio-temporal units. The warehouse allows the implementation of
    calculations on raw analytical results (pH, carbon, phosphorus, etc.), but also on attributes resulting from a calculation,
    such as the fine silt to coarse silt ratio, the agronomic interpretation of phosphorus, the soil saturation rate."
