  title: "Statistiques spatio-temporelles sur les propri\xE9t\xE9s agronomiques des\
    \ sols agricoles en France issues de la Base de Donn\xE9es d'Analyses de Terre\
    \ (BDAT)"
  abstract: 'In France, farmers commission about 250,000 soil-testing analyses per
    year to assist them managing soil fertility. The number and diversity of origin
    of the samples make these analyses an interesting and original information source
    regarding cultivated topsoil variability. Moreover, these analyses relate to several
    parameters strongly influenced by human activity (macronutrient contents, pH...),
    for which existing cartographic information is not very relevant. Compiling the
    results of these analyses into a database makes it possible to re-use these data
    within both a national and temporal framework. A database compilation relating
    to data collected over the period 1990-2014 has been recently achieved. So far,
    commercial soil-testing laboratories approved by the Ministry of Agriculture have
    provided analytical results from more than 3,600,000 samples. After the initial
    quality control stage, analytical results from more than 1,900,000 samples were
    available in the database. The anonymity of the landholders seeking soil analyses
    is perfectly preserved, as the only identifying information stored is the location
    of the nearest administrative city to the sample site. We present in this dataset
    a set of statistical parameters of the spatial distributions for several agronomic
    soil properties. These statistical parameters are calculated for 4 different nested
    spatial entities (administrative areas: e.g. regions, departments, counties and
    agricultural areas) and for 5 time periods (1990-1994, 1995-1999, 2000-2004, 2005-2009,
    2010-2014). Two kinds of agronomic soil properties are available: the first one
    correspond to the quantitative variables like the organic carbon content, and
    the second one corresponds to the qualitative variables like the texture class.
    For each spatial unit and temporal period, we calculated the following statistics
    sets: the first set is calculated for the quantitative variables and corresponds
    to the number of samples, the mean, the standard deviation and, the 2-,4-,10-quantiles;
    the second set is calculated for the qualitative variables and corresponds to
    the number of samples, the value of the dominant class, the number of samples
    of the dominant class, the second dominant class, the number of samples of the
    second dominant class.'
