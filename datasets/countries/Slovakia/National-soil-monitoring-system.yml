  title: National Soil Monitoring System in Slovakia
  abstract: >
    The data set represents digital data archived from the "partial monitoring system - soil" 
    as part of the environmental monitoring of Slovakia. The main objective of soil monitoring 
    is the temporary registration of changes in soil properties important from the environmental 
    perspective. An important part of CMSP is the monitoring of risk elements in the soils and the 
    possibilities of their entry into the food chain. Regular update allows you to monitor temporary 
    development and changes in the soil properties of the current situation as well as trends in soil 
    contamination.
