  title: Agricultural Soil Profiles Database
  abstract: 'The digital database of sampling probes of the Complex Soil Survey (KPP) forms the \
  \ basic soil science database on the characteristics of soils in Slovakia. KPP-DB was created \
  \ by digitizing additional text documentation to the so-called KPP selection probes (Linke≈° et \
  \ al. 1987). KPP-DB contains general probe data and a database of basic morphological, physical \ 
  \ and chemical properties of soils. Through the x, y coordinates of individual profiles, their  \
  \ spatial localization is ensured, which enables the processing of KPP-DB data in a GIS \
  \ environment (point layer).
  \
  \ To be implemented in INSPIRE.'
