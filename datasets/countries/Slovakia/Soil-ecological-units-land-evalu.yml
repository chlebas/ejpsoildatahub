  title: "Bonified soil-ecological units in Slovakia"
  abstract: 'The concept of credit rating of agricultural land basically follows the traditional principles\
    \ of credit rating in our country. Each plot is characterized by parameters of soil - ecological properties\
    \ expressed by the so-called "bonified soil-ecological units" (BPEJ).  The database contains data on the X,Y\
    \ coordinates of polygons describing the boundaries of individual areas of the BPEJ and other area units:\
    \ forests, water bodies, other areas (barren lands), urban areas and other built-up areas.\
    \ The database was created by digitizing the professional content from the original BPEJ maps developed on the basis of the State Map derived 1:5000.\
    \ Fisrst data were colected 1971-1976. Continuous update on request.'
