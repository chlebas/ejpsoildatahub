  title: ICP Forests level I plots in Portugal
  abstract: '1) Soil profile sampling. And, also, 2) Sampling at fixed depths,3 pits
    until 80 cm and 2 small pits until 20 cm depth located in the 4 cardinal points
    of each plot. Composite soil sample of 12-14 subsamples per depth; for Bulk density,
    only, 5 undisturbed samples per depth ; The 1st ICP Forests Soil condition survey
    was carried out in 1994-1995 (Vanmechelen et al., 1997). Soil profile sampling
    in the BioSoil soil survey, carried out in 2007-2008 following Mikkelsen, J. et
    al. 2006 Guidelines for Forest Soil Profile Description, adapted for optimal field
    observations within the framework of the EU Forest Focus Demonstration Project.
