  title: INFOSOLO - Soil Profile Data for Portugal
  abstract: The INFOSOLO legacy database is the first effort to develop a soil information
    system in Portugal, suitable to compile soil data produced in the country, and
    to support stakeholders and land managers in decision-making. The current version
    includes soil data from a set of 9934 horizons/layers studied in 3461 soil profiles
    across the country between 1966 and 2014. Data was extracted from scattered soil
    surveys, research projects, and academic studies carried out by public Portuguese
    and other European institutions. As the level of detail of soil information varied
    between datasets, a series of validation tests and harmonization procedures were
    implemented in order to access and improve the quality of the data
