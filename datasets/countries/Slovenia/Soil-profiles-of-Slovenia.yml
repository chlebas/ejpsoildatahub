  title: Soil profiles of Slovenia
  abstract: "1644 points of detailed soil profile description using standard soil\
    \ science methods. The profiles were carried out between 1960 and 1999 during\
    \ the making of the soil map of Slovenia in 1:25.000. Soil profiles were updated\
    \ in 2015 so currently there is 1879 soil profiles. Each soil profile contains\
    \ the data about soil type (by the Slovenian soil classification system,), year\
    \ of excavation, location (x and y coordinates by national D48 CRS), elevation,\
    \ slope, exposition, land use, type of parent material). Soil profile table relates\
    \ to attached soil horizon data which contains 5440 soil horizons with the data\
    \ about soil profile ID, type of horizon, upper and lower depth of horizon (in\
    \ cm), color (by Munsell), coarse material in the horizon, as well as some measured\
    \ soil parameters such as soil pH, soil texture parameters, phosphorus, potassium,\
    \ organic matter, and organic content, nitrogen, C/N ratio, CEC (cation exchange\
    \ capacity). "
