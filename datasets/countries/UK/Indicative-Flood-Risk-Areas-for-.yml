  title: Indicative Flood Risk Areas (shapefiles)
  abstract: "Set of shapefiles defining Indicative Flood Risk Areas for local risk.\
    \  Indicative Flood Risk Areas are provided by the Environment Agency for use\
    \ by Lead Local Flood Authorities in England in their review during 2017 of Preliminary\
    \ Flood Risk Assessments and Flood Risk Areas under the Flood Risk Regulations.\n\
    \nThe Indicative Flood Risk Areas are primarily based on an aggregated 1km square\
    \ grid Updated Flood Map for Surface Water (1 in 100 and 1000 annual probability\
    \ rainfall), informally referred to as the \u201Cblue square map\u201D. These\
    \ are 1km grids across England and consist of the following data layers:\n\n\u2022\
    \tSurface Water Flood Risk Exposure Grid \u2013 1km square grid that shows places\
    \ above the flood risk threshold defined, using the 1 in 100 and 1000 annual probability\
    \ (deep) Flood Map for Surface Water.\n\u2022\tFlood risk thresholds used to generate\
    \ the \u201Cblue Squares\u201D:\n-\tNumber of people > 200\n-\tNumber of critical\
    \ services, including electricity and water > 1\n-\tNumber of non-residential\
    \ properties > 20 \n\u2022\tCluster Maps \u2013 are aggregations of 3km by 3km\
    \ squares that each contain at least 5 touching \"blue squares\" (i.e. 1km grid\
    \ squares where one of the thresholds above is exceeded)\n\u2022\tCommunities\
    \ at Risk by Lead Local Flooding Authority\n\u2022\tPeople Sensitivity Map by\
