  title: Map of soil erosion risk (partial cover)
  abstract: "The map shows the risk of a bare soil being eroded by water under intense\
    \ or prolonged rainfall and primarily covers the cultivated land in Scotland.\
    \ Soils with mineral topsoils have been classified separately from those with\
    \ organic (peaty) surface layers. The risk of soil erosion is shown in 3 main\
    \ classes for soils with mineral topsoils; High, Moderate or Low. The risk of\
    \ erosion is greatest on coarse textured soils with a low water adsorption capacity\
    \ on steep slopes. Each main class is divided into 3 subclasses (H1-3, M1-3 and\
    \ L1-3) with the greater numbers in each risk class indicating a higher risk of\
    \ erosion due to increases in slope, soil textures becoming more coarse and/or\
    \ the soils having a lesser ability to absorb rainfall.\nThe risk of soil erosion\
    \ for soils with organic (peaty) surfaces is also shown in 3 classes; High, Moderate\
    \ or Low. The Moderate and Low erosion risk classes are divided into subclasses\
    \ (Mi\u2013iv and Li-iii) with the greater numbers (i-iv) in each risk class indicating\
    \ a higher risk of erosion due to increases in slope and/or the soils having a\
    \ lesser ability to absorb rainfall."
