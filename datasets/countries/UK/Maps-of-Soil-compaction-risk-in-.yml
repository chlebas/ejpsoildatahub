  title: Map of topsoil compaction risk (partial cover)
  abstract: 'The map shows the risk of the topsoil becoming compacted due to the passage
    of machinery. This map primarily covers the cultivated land in Scotland and provides
    information on the risk of topsoil compaction.The topsoil compaction risk gives
    information of the likelihood of the topsoil becoming compacted  in 3 classes:
    High, Moderate or Low. The risk is based on the natural drainage class of the
    soil and the soil texture.'
