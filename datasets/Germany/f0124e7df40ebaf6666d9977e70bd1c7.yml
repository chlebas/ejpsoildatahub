  title: German Agricultural Soil Inventory
  abstract: 'At each site, soil profiles were dug to 100 cm depth. Soil morphology
    was characterised based on soil horizons following AD-HOC-AG Boden (2005), while
    composite soil samples for laboratory analysis were taken at fixed depth increments
    (0-10, 10-30, 30-50, 50-70 and 70-100 cm). If a horizon boundary was at least
    5 cm above or below a sampling boundary, an additional soil sample was taken.
    This allowed laboratory and field data to be merged. Farmers were asked on land
    use and management using a questionnaire. This was the first soil German Agricultural
    Soil Inventory. A second one is planned. After that?
