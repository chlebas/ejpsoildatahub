  title: First German Agricultural Soil Inventory
  abstract: "The Federal Republic of Germany is obliged to report all anthropogenic\
    \ sources and sinks of greenhouse gases on a national scale. Changes in soil organic\
    \ carbon (SOC) stocks are among these sources and sinks. Furthermore, soil organic\
    \ matter is a key indicator of soil fertility. The Th\xFCnen Institute of Climate-Smart\
    \ Agriculture was commissioned by the German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture\
    \ to conduct the first German agricultural soil inventory and obtain a first representative\
    \ and consistent baseline of SOC stocks in agricultural soils across Germany.\
    \ Potential explanatory variables were also assessed. Between 2009 and 2018, a\
    \ total of 3104 field sites were sampled in a 8x8 km grid (Jacobs et al., 2018).\
