  title: Adoption rate of 58 innovative soil management practices
  abstract: 'The dataset is based on survey national experts in soil sciences. The
    survey aimed, among other, to identify the current level of adoption of a list
    of 58 soil management practices in the different countries and Environmental Zones
    across Europe of partners countries or regions, following the classification of
    Rogers (2003). In detail, five qualitative classes were defined: - only by a few
    farmers (e.g., the innovators) (approx. < 2.5% of farmers) - by the early adopters
    (approx. < 16% of farmers) - by an early majority (approx. < 50% of farmers) -
    by a late majority (approx. <84% of farmers) - by all farmers (approx. 100% of
    farmers) The list of 58 soil management practices was established in a preliminary
    inventory done in the framework of i-SoMPE : A preliminary list of well-documented
    Soil Management Practices (SMPs) was set up by reviewing published articles and
    reports from specific European Research projects, also including deliverables
    from the EJP SOIL programme. A preliminary check of the type and characteristics
    of each of SMPs was done in order to avoid to repeat twice the same practice in
    the inventory list of SMPs. After completing the preliminary check, a total of
    58 SMPs were selected and briefly described. According to the EJP SOIL classification,
    they were grouped in 7 land management categories as follows: - agricultural systems,
    - buffer strips and small landscape elements, - crop protection, - crops and crop
    rotations, - organic matter and nutrient management,  - tillage and trafic, -
    water management The data were processed and crossed with the shapefiles of the
    agroecological zones (AEZ) for producing maps of adoption (!! not based on statistics).
    These maps are published in the report and will be shared online in image files
    in the i-SoMPE Community on Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/communities/i-sompe/?page=1&size=20)

      It must be very clear that it is the perception of actual implementation
      by national experts (and not data from national statistics), as it was explained
      in the i-Sompe report Frederic Vanwindekens, Olivier Heller, Claudia Di Bene,
      & Pasquale Nino. (2022). Adoption rate of 58 innovative soil management practices
      (maps of inventory A) (1.0) [Data set]. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6510954
      The origin of the data is a survey among partners of the EJP SOIL project (linked
      to national experts in agricultural soil). Frederic Vanwindekens processed the
      data set with supervision of colleagues and projects co-leaders. All data were
      processed in R for formatting the data. For each country, in marginal Environment
      Zones the same adoption rate of a SMP was assigned as for the neighbouring documented
      zones. This ex-post analysis was done automatically using a script that can
      be consulted in annex F.2.
