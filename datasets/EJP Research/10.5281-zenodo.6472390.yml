  title: Long term climatic data for i-SoMPE
  abstract: 'These maps were created for the i-SoMPE project within EJP SOIL in 2021
    and 2022. They were used to calculate various climatic variables for the characterization
    of the Agro-Environmental Zones (AEZ) of Europe and to assess the potential area
    of application of soil managament practices. The input data was long term average
    (1991 - 2020) climatic data (min. temp., max. temp., mean. temp., ET0, Prec.)
    for every day of the year for every Agri4Cast grid cell. We calculated 11 climatic
    variables: meanTemp: Mean annual temperature meanPrec: Mean annual precipitation
    sum meanET0: Mean annual potential evapotranspiration sum GrowSeason: Average
    length of the growing season (number of days per year with average temperature
    above 5C) GrowSeason_class: Classification of the length of the growing season:
    < 200 days short; 200 to 300 days intermediate; >300 days long (Metzger et al.,
    2012) TempSum :Average annual temperature sum (sum of all average daily temperatures
    above 0C) TempSum_class: Classification of the temperature sum: < 2000 C = cold;
    2000 to 3000 C = cool temperate; 3000 to 4000 C = temperate; 4000 to 5000 C =
    warm temperate; > 5000 C = hot (Metzger et al., 2012) HeatDay: Average number
    of heat days (number of days per year with average maximal temperature above 30C)
    FrostDay: Average number of frost days (number of days per year with average minimal
    temperature below 0C) WaterBalance: Mean annual water balance (meanPrec meanET0)
    DryDay: Average number of days per year with a negative water balance (Prec ET0)
