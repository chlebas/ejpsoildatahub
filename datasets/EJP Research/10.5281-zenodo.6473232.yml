  title: Agroecological Zones of Europe used for i-SoMPE
  abstract: 'This dataset was compiled in the i-SoMPE Project of EJP SOIL in 2021
    and 2022. This dataset contains information to characterize the agroecological
    zones (AEZ) of Europe on 4 spatial levels. The data was calculated by an R project
    available on GitLab (https://gitlab.com/heoi/i-sompe-wp1) using various data on
    land use, climate, soil characteristics and slope. More information on the data
    can be found in the report of the i-SoMPE project. The dataset contains the following
    files: - 1 ZIP-Folder with a shapefile of the AEZs used in i-SoMPE and described
    in the dataset - 1 XLSX file with information on all 4 spatial levels - 4 CSV
    files with information on 1 of 4 spatial levels - 1 XLSX file that contains information
    on the attributes described in the dataset
