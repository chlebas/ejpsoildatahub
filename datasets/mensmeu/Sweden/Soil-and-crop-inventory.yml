  title: Soil and crop inventory
  abstract: 'Swedish national soil monitoring programme of agricultural soils. The programme started in 1995 and covers about 2000 sites in a regular grid across agricultural land revisited each 10th year. The programme is funded by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency and managed by the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU). Data. Topsoil (0-20 cm): pH H20, texture, total carbon and nitrogen, carbonate carbon, exchangeable cations (Ca, K, Mg, Na and acidityâ€“from which cation exchange capacity and degree of base saturation is calculated), plant nutrients (ammonium-lactate acetate extractable P, K, Al and Fe; 2M HCl extractable P and K) and trace element concentrations. Subsoil (40-60 cm): texture.'
