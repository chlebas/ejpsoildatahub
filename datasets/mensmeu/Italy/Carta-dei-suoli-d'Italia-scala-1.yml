  title: "The soil province geodatabase of Italy, storing information of soil typological units and broad soil regions at the 1:1,000,000 and 1:10,000,000 scales"
  abstract: 'The Soil Map of Italy at 1:1,000,000 scale, was the result of the work of Edoardo AC Costantini, Giovanni L''Abate, Roberto Barbetti, Maria Fantappi√©, Romina Lorenzetti, and Simona Magini affiliated to Research Centre for agrobiology and soil science (CREA-ABP), in collaboration with several regional institutions, universities and other research centers of the CREA - Consiglio per la ricerca in agricoltura e l''analisi dell''economia agraria. The map, was printed by S.EL.CA. of Florence. The map is an informative and educational work of general scientific interest, which updates the previous one edited by prof. Fiorenzo Mancini and collaborators in 1966 both in terms of knowledge and of the adopted methods. It was produced processing of all data within a geographical and soil geodatabase, collected by the CREA-ABP and other institutions collaborating in over ten years of work and using the latest international methods. The soil map shows the distribution of major soils in the country and constitutes a milestone in the process launched in 1999 as part of the project the Soil Map of Italy at a scale of 1:250,000, funded by MIPAAF and implemented in collaboration with the regional institutions. Both broad soil regions and soil provinces (reference scale 1:10,000,000 and 1:1,000,000) are reported. Most small-scale soil maps report dominant typological units and allow only a partial appraisal of pedodiversity since territories with similar dominant soils can actually possess different pedodiversity. This is particularly true at the national scale, where a great wealth of soil information collected at more detailed scales is generalized. \n A methodology was set up, which aimed at preserving pedodiversity in upscaling soil maps by using geomatic techniques and the World Reference Base for soil resources (WRB). The main source of information was the soil system geodatabase of Italy, storing information of soil typological units and soilscapes at the 1:500,000 reference scale. Qualitative aggregation of soil taxa followed upscaling rules aimed at (i) maintaining the information about pedogenetic processes and (ii) grouping soilscapes showing recurrent patterns of soil forming processes. The upscaling methodology can be summarized in seven steps as follows (1) soil forming processes selection, retrieved from soil typological units stored in the national database; (2) upscaling soil systems and creation of broad soil regions at 1:10,000,000 reference scale; (3) semantic upscaling of typological units to form taxa showing different soil forming processes; (4) ranking and associating soil forming processes; (5) geography upscaling of soil systems geometry to form polygons at 1:1,000,000 reference scale, called subregions; (6) ranking subregions according to their extension; (7) naming subregions by ranking the taxa according to the number of soil typological units. \n The soil subregion map reported 47 map unit and 148 taxa, belonging to 22 reference soil group of WRB and showing from one to four qualifiers. Each map unit had from 2 to 18 taxa, for a total of 317 occurrences. Thirty taxa had 3 or more occurrences, while the remaining took place in one or two subregions only.
